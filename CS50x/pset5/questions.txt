0.  BMP: up to 4 294 967 296 colors (32 bpp); GIF: 256 colors; JPEG: 16 000 000 colors; PNG: 256 colors
1.  GIF supports animation
2.  Lossy compression is a data encoding method that discards some data, usually unnoticeable if in an image or video file. Lossless compression recreates the data perfectly and is used mostly for textual data.
3.  JPEG is lossy compressed.
4.  "Deleting" a file merely rewrites the metadata that pointed to the file but leaves the disk blocks containing the files contents intact.
5.  To ensure total deletion, one could use a commercial or free "sanitization" software tool which overwrites deleted memory blocks, for example, by writing zeroes or random characters.
6.  Stdint.h is a library that includes integer data types of guaranteed fixed size across all implementations.
7.  Using these integer types (uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, uint16_t) ensures the variables represented are exactly 8, 32, or 16 bits.
8.  BYTE == 8 bits; DWORD == 32 bits; LONG == 32 bits; WORD == 16 bits
9.  The first two bytes of any BMP file are the characters 'B' and 'M' in 1-byte ASCII encoding.
10. bfSize is the size in bytes of the bitmap file, while biSize is the total number of byte required by the structure.
11. If biHeight is negative, the origin of the bitmap begins in the upper left corner (as opposed to lower left).
12. biBitCount represents the bits per pixel - the color depth - of the BMP.
13. fopen() would return NULL in copy.c:37 if for some reason the output file couldn't be created.
14. The third arg in fread() is always 1 in our code because we only want to read 1 object (e.g. 1 pixel, 1 header).
15. copy.c:70 assigns the value -1 to <padding> if bi.biWidth is 3. >>> int padding =  (4 - (bi.biWidth * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE)) % 4) % 4;
16. fseek() sets the file position data for the given stream. You might use this to skip over padding in a bitmap.
17. SEEK_CUR means to seek from the current location.
18. Milo Banana dun it.
